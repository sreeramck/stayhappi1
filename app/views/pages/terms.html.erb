If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or via the Application or provide you with notice of the modification. By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services.<br>

	 How the Site, Application and Services Work<br>
	 The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of residential and other properties (“Accommodations”).

Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Stayhappi platform, Stayhappi’s responsibilities are limited to: (i) facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services and (ii) serving as the limited payment collection agent of each Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host.<br>
	 PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE HOSTS AND GUESTS CONNECTING AND BOOKING ACCOMMODATIONS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. STAYHAPPI CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ACCOMMODATIONS. STAYHAPPI IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND ACCOMMODATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE AT THE GUEST’S OWN RISK.<br>
	 Account Registration<br>
	 In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to book an Accommodation or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (“Stayhappi Account”) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.<br>
	 You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a “Third-Party Account”), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Stayhappi Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Stayhappi through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Stayhappi to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Stayhappi and/or grant Stayhappi access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Stayhappi to pay any fees or making Stayhappi subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Stayhappi access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Stayhappi will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“SNS Content”) so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Stayhappi Account and Stayhappi Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Stayhappi Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Stayhappi’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Stayhappi Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Stayhappi makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Stayhappi is not responsible for any SNS Content.<br>
	 We will create your Stayhappi Account and your Stayhappi Account profile page for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Stayhappi Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Stayhappi reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Stayhappi Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Stayhappi Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Stayhappi Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Stayhappi of any unauthorized use of your Stayhappi Account.<br>
	 Accommodation Listings<br>
	 As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Accommodation and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price than in the booking request.<br>
	 You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Stayhappi assumes no responsibility for a Host’s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Stayhappi reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Stayhappi, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Stayhappi’s then-current Policies and Community Guidelines, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.<br>
	 If you are a Host, you understand and agree that Stayhappi does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Stayhappi is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Stayhappi serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, payments from Guests of such amounts stipulated by the Host (including cleaning or other fees and/or Taxes).
	 When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Accommodation, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the “Hosting” section of the Site, Application and Services.<br>
	 If you are a Host, Stayhappi makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)<br>
	 Stayhappi recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.<br>
	 Stayhappi may offer Hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their Accommodations. If you as a Host choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words “Stayhappi.com Verified Photo” or similar wording (“Verified Images”). All images, materials and content created by these photographers provided by Stayhappi, including Verified Images, constitute Stayhappi Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing.<br>
	 No Endorsement<br>
	 Stayhappi does not endorse any Member or any Accommodation. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Accommodation at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Stayhappi of any Member or any Accommodation. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although Stayhappi may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member’s purported identity or background.<br>
	 Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being “verified” or “connected” (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Stayhappi about any Member, including of the Member’s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a Host or to accept a booking request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the Stayhappi Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions which is an agreement between Stayhappi and Hosts, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.<br>
	 By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Stayhappi with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against Stayhappi regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Stayhappi on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.<br>
	 Bookings and Financial Terms<br>
	 Key definitions<br>
	 “Accommodation Fees” means the amounts that are due and payable by a Guest in exchange for that Guest’s stay in an Accommodation. The Host alone, and not Stayhappi, determines these amounts. The Host may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on the Stayhappi platform, or (ii) Taxes that the Host determines that he or she has to collect.  “Guest Fees” means the fee that Stayhappi charges a Guest for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Guest Fees will be displayed to the Guest when the Guest is asked whether to send a booking request to a Host.  “Host Fees” means the fee that Stayhappi charges a Host for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Host Fees will be displayed to the Host when the Host is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking request from a prospective Guest.  “Service Fees” means collectively the Guest Fees and the Host Fees.  “Total Fees” means collectively the Accommodation Fees and the Guest Fees (plus any Taxes in respect of Guest Fees, such as VAT).<br>
	 Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts<br>
	 If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the booking request will be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest’s Stayhappi Account profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are “friends” or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also “friends” or associated with the Guest on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that the Guest provided to Stayhappi when the Guest became a Member matches the name that the Guest provided to the SNSs to which the Guest has linked his or her Stayhappi Account, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking request. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by Stayhappi for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest’s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Stayhappi will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.<br>
	 Stayhappi will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less Stayhappi’s Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest). The time it takes for the Host to receive payouts may depend upon the method for receiving payouts chosen by the Host. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Host, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.<br>
	 If you owe or agree to pay any amount to Stayhappi (whether as a result of your bookings or actions as a Guest or otherwise), then Stayhappi may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Stayhappi from any payout amounts due to you as a Host, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to Stayhappi. If Stayhappi does so, then your obligation to pay Stayhappi will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by Stayhappi, and Stayhappi will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld.<br>
	 Appointment of Stayhappi as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Host<br>
	 Each Host hereby appoints Stayhappi as the Host’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Accommodation Fees from Guests.<br>
	 Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest through Stayhappi shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host, and the Host will make the Accommodation available to the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if the Host has received the Accommodation Fees. Each Host agrees that Stayhappi may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Host understands that as Stayhappi accepts payments from Guests as the Host’s limited payment collection agent, Stayhappi’s obligation to pay the Host is subject to and conditional upon Stayhappi successfully receiving the payments from Guests. Stayhappi does not guarantee payments to Hosts for amounts that have not been successfully received from Guests. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Stayhappi assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.<br>
	 Please note that Stayhappi does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you as a Host acknowledge and agree that Stayhappi reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Stayhappi will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.<br>
	 Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests<br>
	 The Hosts, not Stayhappi, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Stayhappi, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Stayhappi is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Stayhappi disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Stayhappi is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, Stayhappi acts as the Host’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to Stayhappi, your payment obligation to the Host for the Accommodation Fees is extinguished, and Stayhappi is responsible for remitting the Accommodation Fees (less Stayhappi’s Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that Stayhappi does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Host will have recourse only against Stayhappi.<br>
	 The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Guest before the Guest sends a booking request to a Host. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Stayhappi will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit card will be released, if applicable.<br>
	 You as a Guest agree to pay Stayhappi for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Stayhappi Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Stayhappi, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting, to verify your credit card. Once Stayhappi receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Stayhappi will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Stayhappi cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Stayhappi’s collection of the Total Fees, and Stayhappi disclaims all liability in this regard.<br>
	 In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Stayhappi or its third-party payment processor. You agree to pay Stayhappi for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Stayhappi Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Stayhappi or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Stayhappi to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under “Damage to Accommodations” below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Stayhappi’s third-party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.<br>
	 Security Deposits<br>
	 Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“Security Deposits”). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of an Accommodation, Stayhappi will, in its capacity as the payment collection agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Guest’s credit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the Guest’s check-in at the applicable Host’s Accommodation. Stayhappi will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Stayhappi is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.<br>
	 Service Fees<br>
	 In consideration for the use of Stayhappi’s online marketplace and platform, Stayhappi charges the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) may also be charged in respect of the Host Fees and Guest Fees. Stayhappi deducts the Host Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the Host as described in these Terms. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.<br>
	 Balances will be remitted by Stayhappi to Hosts via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Host’s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services. Amounts may be rounded up or down as described the “Rounding Off” section below.<br>
	 Please note that Stayhappi may impose or deduct foreign currency processing costs on or from any remittances by Stayhappi in currencies other than Indian Rupees. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.<br>
	 General Booking and Financial Terms<br>
	 Cancellations and Refunds<br>
	 If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Stayhappi will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Guest Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the Host.<br>
	 If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Stayhappi will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Stayhappi containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest’s requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Stayhappi the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Stayhappi, please contact Stayhappi using the contact us section.<br>
	 If, as a Host, you cancel a confirmed booking, Stayhappi may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.<br>
	 In certain circumstances, Stayhappi may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in Stayhappi’s Extenuating Circumstances policy or for any other reason. Stayhappi may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Guest part or all of the amounts charged to the Guest in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy. You agree that Stayhappi and the relevant Guest or Host will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.<br>
	 Recurring Payments<br>
	 In some instances, Guests may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking before beginning his or her stay at the applicable Accommodation (collectively, “Recurring Payments”). More information on Recurring Payments will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable. If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed booking, then the Guest authorizes Stayhappi, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees and the Host agrees that Stayhappi will initiate payouts to the Host, in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, identified on the Site, Application and Services.<br>
	 Rounding Off<br>
	 Stayhappi may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Stayhappi will round up an amount of       101.50 to  102.00, and  101.49 to  101.00.
	 Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Stayhappi may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Stayhappi to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.<br>
	 Payment Processing Errors<br>
	 We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.  Donations<br>
	 Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Host in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.
	 Taxes<br>
	 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Hosts, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. If you as a Host fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold payments to you, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.
	 You as a Host understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Stayhappi cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.
	 You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the “Tax Authority”) where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected by Hosts from Guests on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes are generally required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the rent or Accommodation Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called “occupancy taxes,” “hotel taxes,” “lodging taxes,” “transient taxes,” “sales and use taxes,” “value added taxes,” “room taxes” or “tourist taxes” (hereafter, "Occupancy Taxes").
	 In certain jurisdictions, Stayhappi may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from Guests on behalf of and in-lieu of Hosts, if such tax jurisdiction asserts Stayhappi or Hosts have a tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes, whether you are a Guest or Host you hereby instruct and authorize Stayhappi to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on behalf of and in lieu of Hosts at the time Accommodation Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. When Stayhappi facilitates collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, Stayhappi will provide notice to existing Hosts with Listings for Accommodations in such jurisdictions. The amount of Occupancy Taxes collected and remitted through facilitation by Stayhappi, if any, will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Guests and Hosts agree that in any jurisdiction where Stayhappi facilitates collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes on behalf of and lieu of Hosts, such Hosts are not permitted to also collect and/or remit such taxes on any portion of the Accommodation Fees. Hosts and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, Stayhappi may not be able to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes. In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority in your jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations. For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes, Hosts and Guests expressly grant us permission to transfer data and other information relating to Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted relating to your transactions.
	 Whether you are a Guest of Host, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to collection and remittance of Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Stayhappi in connection with collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Stayhappi from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.<br>
	 Damage to Accommodations<br>
	 As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Stayhappi Account. Stayhappi also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Stayhappi Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Stayhappi in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Stayhappi’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts, and in relation to any payments made by Stayhappi to Hosts. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Accommodation to the applicable Host or to Stayhappi (if applicable).
	 Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Stayhappi in good faith, and to provide Stayhappi with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Stayhappi, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Stayhappi Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Stayhappi or a representative of Stayhappi regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services.
	 If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Stayhappi reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by Stayhappi under the Stayhappi Host Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Stayhappi in good faith, and to provide Stayhappi with such information as may be reasonably requested by Stayhappi, in order to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Stayhappi may reasonably request to assist Stayhappi in accomplishing the foregoing.<br>
	 Foreign Currency<br>
	 Stayhappi’s online platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Hosts who may prefer to pay and to receive payments in different currencies, which may require foreign currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the Stayhappi platform allows users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location.
	 Each foreign currency conversion is processed at a foreign currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of US dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to US dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.<br>
	 Key definitions<br>
	 “Display Currency” means the currency in which users view Listing prices on the Stayhappi platform. Guests may choose and change the Display Currency in order to view the pricing for a Listing in a number of different supported currencies.  “Booking Currency” means the currency in which a Guest has to pay for his or her booking. At the time the Guest submits a booking request, the Stayhappi platform will select the Booking Currency, based on the Guest’s country of origin and the payment methods available for that country. Stayhappi supports only a certain number of currencies as Booking Currencies. The Booking Currency for a booking may be different from the relevant Listing Currency.  “Listing Currency” means the currency in which a Listing’s price is set. The Listing Currency is set by the Host.  “Payout Currency” means the currency in which a Host’s payout will be paid to the Host. The Payout Currency is set by the Host.  “Base Exchange Rate” means a system-wide rate used by Stayhappi for foreign currency conversion that is in effect at the time the foreign currency conversion is processed, and does not include any fee or mark-up by Stayhappi. Stayhappi establishes the Base Exchange Rate using data from one or more third parties.  “Adjusted Exchange Rate” means a rate for foreign currency conversion that is calculated by adding a mark-up to the Base Exchange Rate. This mark-up represents a charge imposed by Stayhappi for its holding costs and foreign currency risks.
	 Foreign currency conversions on the Stayhappi platform<br>
	 Stayhappi will process a foreign currency conversion in the following situations:<br>
	  
	 	•	The Display Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a user views a Listing: Stayhappi will calculate the estimated Total Fees in the Display Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the view to the estimated Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is a supported Booking Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.
	 	•	The Booking Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a Guest submits a booking request for a Listing: Stayhappi will calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the booking request to the Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Guest will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied. The Guest Fee, which is a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees, will be calculated based on the Accommodation Fees in the Booking Currency (i.e. after conversion from the Listing Currency). The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is the same as the Booking Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency for the Listing. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.
	 	•	The Payout Currency is different from the Listing Currency when Stayhappi initiates a payout: generally, Stayhappi will calculate the payout to the Host, by applying the Base Exchange Rate on the date that Stayhappi initiates the payout to the Accommodation Fees (less Stayhappi 's Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT) in the Listing Currency. The Host will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application. In some cases where the payout method selected by the Host involves certain third-party payment processors (such as Western Union), (i) Stayhappi will send the payout amount to the processor in a major currency (e.g. US dollars), by applying the relevant Base Exchange Rate for the Listing Currency to that major currency, (ii) the Host will be able to view the payout amount sent by Stayhappi in that major currency in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application, and (iii) the processor will calculate the actual payout to the Host by applying its own foreign currency conversion rate for that major currency to the Payout Currency.
	 	•	When a confirmed booking is modified or cancelled, and there had been a foreign currency conversion when the booking was submitted: the foreign currency conversion for any additional payments required of the Guest or any refund to the Guest will be processed at the same rate as applied to the earlier payment by the Guest.
<br>
	 When you as a Guest submit a booking request for a Listing, you will be able to view the actual exchange rate used to calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency. Where the Adjusted Exchange Rate is applied, you will be able to view the mark-up included in the rate. The actual exchange rate (and any mark-up included in the rate) will also be stated in the billing receipt for your booking.<br>
	 Stayhappi updates the Base Exchange Rate on a regular basis, but not on a real-time basis. In particular, Stayhappi does not always change the Base Exchange Rate immediately when its costs of foreign exchange change. Accordingly, the Base Exchange Rate may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time a foreign currency conversion is processed.
	 Please note that your payment company (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) will use a currency conversion rate for and may impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout, if your card or bank account is denominated in a currency that is different from the Booking Currency or the Payout Currency respectively. Similarly, third-party payment processors may also use a currency conversion rate for or impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout. All of these currency conversion rates and fees are not controlled by or known to Stayhappi.<br>

If you choose to participate in the Referral Program, for each friend you refer to Stayhappi for which a Qualifying Referral (defined below) is completed, you may be able to receive Stayhappi Travel Credits (defined below) (each a “Referral Reward”). “Stayhappi Travel Credits” are “points” that may be applied as credits toward future confirmed bookings made by Members via the Site, Application and Services.<br>
	 In order to receive a Referral Reward, each of the following requirements must be met (collectively, a “Qualifying Referral”): (i) you must log in to your Stayhappi Account on the Site or Application and select either the “Invite Friends” or “Email Your Friends” link; (ii) you must share the link provided with friends via Facebook or Twitter, by copying and pasting the unique referral link generated via the Services, by sending the unique referral link generated via the Services in an email via the Services to your friends, or by using the other tools provided by Stayhappi to share the unique referral link with friends; (iii) a friend who clicks the link on Facebook or otherwise or clicks the link contained in the email must create a Stayhappi Account and become a Member; and (iv) after becoming a Member, the friend must either request a booking of an Accommodation which is confirmed by the applicable Host or create a Listing which subsequently receives a confirmed booking via the Services with a Total Value (excluding any cleaning fees) of at least seventy-five U.S. dollars (US$75) (or its equivalent in your local currency if we support it) that is not subsequently cancelled. Please note that you may not be the Host or the Guest for the booking to receive a Referral Reward.<br>
	 It is a condition of the Referral Program that you will circulate or share the unique referral link only to your personal friends. You agree not to publish or distribute the link, or cause the link to be published or distributed, on or via methods, platforms and media where you have no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the readers or recipients are your personal friends. All Stayhappi Account creations and confirmed booking requests resulting from a breach of the above will be disregarded for determining eligibility for Qualifying Referral and are not eligible for Referral Rewards.<br>
	 Satisfaction of a Qualifying Referral and the Referral Reward you receive will be reflected in your Stayhappi Account in a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Qualifying Referral has been completed. The Referral Rewards you accrue will be displayed in your Stayhappi Account profile page.

	 You and Stayhappi agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration , except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Stayhappi are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.<br>

	 4. Cookies, and other Tracking Technologies
	 Stayhappi uses cookies and other similar technologies on the Platform. We may also allow our business partners to use their cookies and other tracking technologies on the Platform. As a result, when you access or use the Platform, you will provide or make available certain information to us and to our business partners.
	 While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. We track your activities if you click on advertisements for Stayhappi services on third party platforms such as search engines and social networks, and may use analytics to track what you do in response to those advertisements.
	 We may, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, also continue to track your behavior on our own Platform for purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product development, fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, as well as to enable you to use and access the Platform and pay for your activities on the Platform. We may also, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, track your behavior on our own Platform to market and advertise our services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.
	 Third parties may not collect information about users’ online activities on the Platform except as described in this policy and our cookie policy.<br>
	 5. Third-party social plugins<br>
	 Our Platform may use social plugins which are provided and operated by third-party companies, such as Facebook’s Like Button.
	 As a result of this, you may send to the third-party company the information that you are viewing on a certain part of our Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the third-party company, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged into your account with the third-party company, then the third party may be able to link information about your visit to our Platform to your account with them. Similarly, your interactions with the social plugin may be recorded by the third party.
	 Please refer to the third party’s privacy policy to find out more about its data practices, such as what data is collected about you and how the third party uses such data.
	 HOW STAYHAPPI USES AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE OR MAKE AVAILABLE
	 We use and process Information about you for the following general purposes: 
	  
	 	•	to enable you to access and use the Platform;
	  
	 	•	to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, Stayhappi’s business, and our users’ experience, such as to perform analytics, conduct research, and for advertising and marketing;
	  
	 	•	to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform, such as fraud detection and prevention, conducting investigations and risk assessments, verifying the address of your listings, verifying any identifications provided by you, and conducting checks against databases such as public government databases;
	  
	 	•	to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information requested by you;
	  
	 	•	where we have your consent, to send you marketing and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you, including information sent on behalf of our business partners that we think you may find interesting. You will be able to unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications in your settings (in the “Account” section) when you login to your Stayhappi account;
	  
	 	•	to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by Stayhappi or our business partners; and
	  
	 	•	to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our users, and enforce our agreements with third parties.

	 HOW STAYHAPPI USES AND PROCESSES USER COMMUNICATIONS
	 We may review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, the Platform may scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking Guests to send them money outside of the Platform, such as by bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well as to debug product offerings.   We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications for sending third party marketing messages to you. We will also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications to third parties. We will also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you consent that Stayhappi, in its sole discretion, may review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.
	 WHEN STAYHAPPI DISCLOSES OR SHARES PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND TO WHOM
	 IMPORTANT: When you use the Platform, your data may be sent to India and possibly other countries
	 We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") including India. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.
	 BUSINESS TRANSFERS BY STAYHAPPI
	 If Stayhappi undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or bankruptcy or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information. In this event, we will not notify you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
	 HOW TO CHANGE OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION, OR CANCEL YOUR STAYHAPPI ACCOUNT
	 You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your Stayhappi account by logging in to your account. If you would like to cancel your Stayhappi account entirely, you can do so by logging in to your account. Please also note that any reviews, forum postings and similar materials posted by you may continue to be publicly available on the Platform in association with your first name, even after your Stayhappi account is cancelled.
	 KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE
	 We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information against the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration of your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no method of storing electronic information, can be 100% secure. So, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your transmissions to us and of your Personal Information that we store.
	 YOUR PRIVACY WHEN YOU ACCESS THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES
	 The Platform will contain links to other websites not owned or controlled by Stayhappi. Stayhappi does not have any control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies, web beacons or other files on your device, or collect and solicit Personal Information from you. They will have their own rules about the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. We encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policies of the other websites that you visit.
	 Some portions of the Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to Google’s terms of use (located at http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html) and Google’s privacy policy (located at http://www.google.com/privacy.html), as may be amended by Google from time to time.
	 SPECIAL FEATURES AND PROGRAMS
	 Referral service and requesting for references
	 The Platform provides a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the Platform. The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to be published on your Stayhappi profile.
	 We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or requests for references via the third party site itself. These messages will be sent by the third party site, and Stayhappi does not collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.
	 You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the email addresses to send these emails to. You can type in the email addresses manually, or you can request Stayhappi to import the contacts in your email account address book(s). In both cases, we will use the information sent to us for the sole purpose of sending your friends and contacts a one-time email, inviting him or her to visit the Platform or to write a reference for you. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email addresses of your invitees to track if your friend joins Stayhappi in response to your referral.
	 If you request us to import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this information only for the purpose of importing your contacts.
	 Affiliate Program
	 If you are allowed to join Stayhappi’s Affiliate Program (see http://www.stayhappi.com) and you sign up for it, you will have to provide us with certain Personal Information to enable us to provide the Affiliate Program to you.
	 Meetups
	 The Platform may allow registered account holders to organize, search for or participate in offline events (“Meetups”) in selected cities.
	 If you organize a Meetup or indicate that you will attend one, this information, together with some of your public information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) and any messages that you post about that Meetup, will be visible to users who browse the event. However, Stayhappi will never disclose where you are staying to another user.
	 Groups
	 The Platform may allow registered account holders to participate in online discussion forums ("Group(s)”) in selected cities.
	 If you join a Group, then your membership in the Group as well as some of your public information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) will be visible to users who browse the Group. If you publish postings in a Group, then your postings will be visible to such users as well. The ability to browse the Group will depend on the Group settings, and it may or may not be limited to members of that Group.
	 CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
	 We may change how we collect and then use Personal Information at any time and without prior notice, at our sole discretion.   We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you either by posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Platform or by sending an email to you. If we let you know of changes through an email communication, then the date on which we send the email will be deemed to be the date of your receipt of that email.
	 It’s important that you review the changed Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Privacy Policy, then we will not be able to continue providing the Platform to you, and your only option will be to stop accessing the Platform and deactivate your Stayhappi account.

	 	•	to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages and browser sessions.
	 	•	to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.
	 	•	to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and optimize it.
	 	•	to show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.

	 Uses for third party cookies
	 Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to Stayhappi. For example, third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise Stayhappi listings or services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.
	 In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the Stayhappi mobile app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified) has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.
	 Disabling Cookies
	 Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (http://www.adobe.com/) and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel (http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html).<br>
	 Changes to this Cookie Policy<br>
	 We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Cookie Policy, we will let you know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email.<br>
	 It’s important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Cookie Policy, then we cannot continue to provide the Platform to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Platform and deactivate your Stayhappi account. You can find out more about how to deactivate your Stayhappi account at http://www.stayhappi.com/<br>
